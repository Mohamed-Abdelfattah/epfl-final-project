Building an app to help trainees and trainers track progress, create activities, and share resources is a great idea. You'll need to consider several aspects:

User Authentication: Secure login for trainees and trainers.
User Roles and Permissions: Different features available for trainees and trainers.
Progress Tracking: Functionality for tracking and visualizing progress over time.
Activity Management: Tools for creating, assigning, and managing activities.
Resource Sharing: A way to share training materials and resources.
Here's a high-level overview of how you might structure such an app and some tools and frameworks you could use:

Frontend:
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React Router: For navigation within your React application.
Redux or Context API: For state management.
Material-UI or Bootstrap: For styled components and responsive design.
Backend:
Node.js with Express: For your server-side logic.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing user data, progress, and resources.
Mongoose: An ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js.
Passport: For handling user authentication.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure transmission of user information.
Workflow Example:
User Authentication:

Implement user signup and login
Use Passport for authentication and JWT for session management
User Roles and Permissions:

Define roles for trainees and trainers
Implement authorization to restrict access based on roles
Progress Tracking:

Create a model for tracking user progress
Provide endpoints to update and retrieve progress data
Use a charting library like Chart.js on the frontend for visualizations
Activity Management:

Implement CRUD operations for activities
Allow trainers to create and assign activities to trainees
Allow trainees to mark activities as complete
Resource Sharing:

Build a file upload/download system
Use cloud storage like AWS S3 or GridFS with MongoDB for file storage
Implement a resource sharing interface for users to access materials

It is available on GitHub.
It uses the Flask web framework.
It uses at least one module from the Python Standard Library other than the random module (for example, you could use the datetime module.)
It contains at least one class written by you that has both properties and methods. It uses __init__() to let the class initialize the object's properties (note that __init__() doesn't count as a method). This includes instantiating the class and using the methods in your app. Methods that only print something in the terminal will not be considered.
It makes use of JavaScript in the front end and uses the localStorage of the web browser.
It uses modern JavaScript (for example, let and const rather than var).
It makes use of the writing to and reading from the same file feature.
It contains both conditional statements and loops.
It doesn't generate any error message even if the user enters a wrong input.
It lets the user enter a value in a text box at some point. This value should be received and processed by your back end Python code.
It is styled using CSS.
The code follows the code and style conventions we introduced in the course, is fully documented using comments and doesn't contain unused or experimental code. In particular, the code should not use print() or console.log() for any information the app user should see. Instead, all user feedback needs to be visible in the browser.

prompt i used:
I want to make a web app that lets trainers/instructors track trainees progress through trainings:

there will be a dashboard which will show different views for the users based on their role (trainer or trainee)
for trainers it will show trainings, trainees, and events
trainers will be able to create a training and invite trainees to enroll and the training/group will have a title, description, start time, duration, trainees (to be added), events (to be added), and milestones for the training, resources to be shared with trainees (links for photos, videos, websites, articles)
trainers will be able to see and overview for trainings and their progress, trainess and their progress throgh each training, events and their date.
trainers will be able to see detailed veiws of each of the above.
trainees will be able to enroll into trainings and see overview of their progress in each training, upcoming events, due dates (based on each training milestones), and resources list.
trainees will be able to see detailed view of each of the above. here are my questions and please answer them in details: 1- how can i make the database for this. 2- how can i build the app using my current project setup of react and flask
